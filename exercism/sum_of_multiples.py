##
## Here is an iteration that takes this exercise a tad more seriously:
##
## - still memory efficient - no sets, no collections
## - looks long but isn't really
## - comments make it look difficult to understand 'cos it probably is
## - with respect to limit, execution time is O(1) :) :)
## - with respect to len(numbers) it is probably around O(n2 ) =:O
##
## I bet it would give any Counter based implementation a run for its money.
